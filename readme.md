## General Commit Rules
	- Code Reviews. Must be signed off by one of the developers.
	- Commit small peices of work. so commit often. Once you've finished your changes then push to the remote repo. 
	- General commit title rules i go with is "ADDED: *Insert Feature name*", "UPDATED: *Insert Feature name*", "Modified: *Insert thing modified*" and "REMOVED: *Insert Feature name*".

## Coding Styles
	- Please use tabs and not spaces if possible
	- Please use CamelCase e.g "thisIsAVariable". not like this "this_is_a_variable". 
	- 

## Repo Guidelines
	- The master branch is used for the most stable and latest release. 
	- The develop branch is used for all things testings and developing. Once a specific commit is stable enough it can be moved into the master branched, or tagged to be pulled into the master branch as release ready.
	- any branches containing the word "feature" are large pieces of work, that will require multiple commits and sometimes testing before being moved(pulled) back into the main develop branch
